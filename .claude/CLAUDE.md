# DynaInfo 2.0 - Project Rules

@~/.claude/settings/claude.md

## Commit Rules (HIGHEST PRIORITY - Explicit Override)

- **NEVER** use "fix" in commit messages → use "resolve", "correct", "improve"
- **NEVER** add "Co-authored-by", "Generated by" or any Claude/AI attribution
- **NEVER** push automatically → always stop after commit and let user decide
- Write from value-added perspective → what improves and why it matters, not just what changed
- Exclude temporary files, debug scripts, test outputs before committing

## Code Quality

- Don't abstract until needed in 2+ places (YAGNI)
- Reuse existing code → always search first
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- No console.log/debug statements in final code
- No dead code or commented blocks

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Fastify 5 + TypeScript 5.7
- PostgreSQL (auth) + ClickHouse (analytics)
- Better Auth + Resend
- Drizzle ORM

**Frontend:**
- React 19 + Vite 7
- HeroUI + Tailwind CSS 4
- TanStack Query + Zustand
- React Router 7
